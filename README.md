# Are you stuck?

One of the most important lessons that I have learnt in life is how to teach myself. That is because in your academic or career path, you will encounter many professors/instructors whose teaching styles will not match your learning style. Luckily, STEM nowadays is very easy to learn by yourself. So I really encourage you guys to learn things on your own. Here are some steps to follow when you are stuck:
  1. Go to the [documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_canvas.asp) or Stack Overflow.
  2. Ask your neighbor. Getting to know your classmate might help you choose teammates for your project.
  3. I have a solution! Go look at it and see if it makes sense.
  4. Ask me!

If you guys don't agree with the paragraph above, I am more than willing to answer you guys.

# Canvas! Drawing!
In this exercise, you will use [HTML5 Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_canvas.asp) to produce a clock. As an extra, you guys can animate it through call back functions!

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`js/index.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments. Note that you will _not_ need to edit the HTML file!

You can see the results of your work by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser. Remember to refresh the page after you update your code, and to check for any errors in the Developer console.

## Be a nice classmate

Did you finish early? Help the people next to you if they have questions. (Optional) Tell your neighbour a funny story about your childhood if you want to make their day. If you had a boring childhood, just say something nice! :satisfied:
